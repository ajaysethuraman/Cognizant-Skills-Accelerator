        "# **Capstone Project: Python-Based Employee Management System**\n",
        "## By Ajay Sethuraman\n",
        "## **Overview**\n",
        "Title: Python-Based Employee Management System\n",
        "Overview\n",
        "The Python-Based Employee Management System is an interactive application designed to manage employee information in an organization. The system enables users to store employee details, track performance, and generate reports based on criteria such as department, performance rating, and more. The project integrates fundamental Python programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, data structures, exception handling, and file handling. This project aims to demonstrate the ability to create a functional, error-resilient application that meets real-world business needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Project Objectives**\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this capstone project is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Develop a Python-based application to manage employee data efficiently.\n",
        "* Implement a performance tracking system where the application calculates and displays employee performance based on user input.\n",
        "* Ensure the system can handle invalid inputs gracefully with appropriate error handling mechanisms.\n",
        "* Allow for report generation based on employee information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**User Stories**\n",
        "\n",
        "**User Story 1: Task Prioritization**\n",
        "\n",
        "As a student or employee manager, I want to organize tasks or employee projects by deadlines and priority so that I can manage the workload efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:** The application will allow the user to input employee tasks or projects with deadlines and priority levels. The system will automatically generate a prioritized task list based on the given priority.\n",
        "\n",
        "**User Story 2: Performance Tracking**\n",
        "\n",
        "As a student or employee manager, I want to track performance across different tasks or projects to identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:** The application will allow for the input of employee performance scores and automatically calculate averages, flagging areas where improvements can be made.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implementation Plan**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 1: Task Management**\n",
        "* Develop input methods for employee task details such as task name, priority, and deadline.\n",
        "* Organize the input data in a way that allows sorting based on priority and deadline.\n",
        "* Output the sorted tasks with clear labels and formatting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 2: Performance Tracking**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Implement methods to track and store employee scores for different tasks.\n",
        "* Calculate the average score for each employee and flag areas where performance is below average.\n",
        "* Allow the user to input feedback for each employee based on performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 3: Error Handling**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Implement exception handling to handle invalid inputs for task management and performance tracking (e.g., non-numeric scores).\n",
        "* Provide appropriate feedback and error messages to the user for all invalid operations.\n",
        "* Enhance application stability by ensuring all errors are logged and handled gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Learning Outcomes**\n",
        "\n",
        "By completing this project, the following skills will be acquired:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python Basics: Understanding and using variables, loops, data structures (lists, dictionaries), and conditional statements.\n",
        "* Error Handling: Applying exception handling mechanisms to catch and manage common errors.\n",
        "* Modular Programming: Breaking down the program into manageable, reusable functions for clarity and maintainability.\n",
        "* File Handling: Using Pythonâ€™s built-in file handling capabilities to store and retrieve data efficiently."
