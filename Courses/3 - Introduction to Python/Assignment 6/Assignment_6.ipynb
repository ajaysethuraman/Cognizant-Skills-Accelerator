        "Errors and exceptions are integral components of programming in Python, ensuring the robustness and fault-tolerance of code. Understanding how to handle errors gracefully not only prevents program crashes but also provides users with informative feedback. This assignment focuses on writing Python code to handle exceptions and errors efficiently by using different exception types, along with the try...except...else...finally construct. Through the completion of the tasks, we will explore the handling of common Python errors such as ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, IndexError, KeyError, and TypeError.\n",

By using the try...except...else...finally construct, we were able to handle these exceptions gracefully, ensuring the program doesn't crash unexpectedly. We also demonstrated how each exception occurs and how it can be handled using the appropriate error messages. This assignment emphasized the importance of writing error-resilient code that can guide users towards providing correct input while maintaining a seamless experience."
