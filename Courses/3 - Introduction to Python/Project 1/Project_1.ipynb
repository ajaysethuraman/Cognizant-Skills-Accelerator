The program will take the user’s age as input and then use conditional statements to determine whether they are old enough to vote. If they are not, the program will also tell them how many years are left until they are eligible. Additionally, we'll add input validation to handle potential errors, such as non-numeric or negative age inputs."

We started by asking for the user's age and then used conditional statements to determine whether they were eligible to vote. We also added input validation to handle errors like negative or non-numeric inputs. By the end of this project, you have a fully functional program that checks voter eligibility and provides a friendly message to the user.\n",
