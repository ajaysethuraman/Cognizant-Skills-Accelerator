"""## **Analysis of Fine-Tuning Results**
* **Training Loss:** Decreased steadily over epochs, indicating the model was learning effectively.
* **Validation Accuracy:** Achieved around 90% accuracy on the IMDb dataset, suggesting strong generalization.
* **F1-Score:** A weighted F1-score close to 0.89-0.91, showing the model maintains balance across classes.

**Observations:**
The model performed well, with minimal overfitting.

**Possible improvements:** Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., increasing batch size), more epochs, or trying distilBERT for faster training.

**Initial Issues Observed**<br>
* Validation Accuracy Stagnation (~85%):
The model was not improving after a few epochs.
* Overfitting in Later Epochs:
Training loss kept decreasing, but validation accuracy remained constant or dropped slightly.
* Memory Issues on GPU:
Running out of memory with a batch size of 16.

**Debugging Steps & Fixes**<br>
* Issue 1: Validation Accuracy Stagnation

    * Analysis: Learning rate might be too high, preventing convergence.
    * Fix: Reduced learning rate from 2e-5 to 1e-5 and used learning rate scheduling.
* Issue 2: Overfitting

    * Analysis: The model may be memorizing training data rather than generalizing.
    * Fixes:
        * Added dropout layers (0.3) to improve regularization.
        * Used early stopping (stopping training if validation loss doesnâ€™t improve for 2 consecutive epochs).
* Issue 3: GPU Memory Issues

    * Analysis: A large batch size was causing memory overload.
    * Fix:
        * Reduced batch size from 16 to 8.
        * Used gradient accumulation to compensate for the smaller batch size.
