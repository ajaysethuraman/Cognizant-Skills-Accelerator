# **Project: Comprehensive Fine-Tuning Task**
**Objective:**
The goal of this project is to fine-tune a lightweight pre-trained language model (DistilBERT) for sentiment analysis on a subset of the IMDB movie reviews dataset. This will involve end-to-end implementation, including dataset preparation, model fine-tuning, evaluation, and insights into real-world applications.

A. **Define Your Domain and Task**<br>
* **Domain:** The domain selected for this task is Sentiment Analysis.

* **Task Objective:** Classifying movie reviews as positive or negative.

* **Expected Output:** For each review, the model will predict a label:

    * 0 (negative)
    * 1 (positive)

B. **Dataset Preparation**<br>
* **Dataset Selection:** The dataset selected is a subset of the IMDB movie reviews dataset. We'll use 200 entries for this task to keep it manageable while still demonstrating the fine-tuning process.

* **Data Collection:** The IMDB dataset can be accessed through the Hugging Face library.

* **Cleaning:**
    * Remove duplicates and irrelevant entries.
    * Normalize text formatting (e.g., lowercase all text).
    * Handle any potential typos or grammatical inconsistencies.

* **Labeling:** The dataset is labeled with positive and negative sentiment, with a balanced class distribution.

C. **Fine-Tune the Model**

"""E. **Analysis and Report**<br>
* **Dataset Insights:**
The IMDB dataset contains movie reviews, each labeled as either positive or negative. The dataset was cleaned by:

    * Removing irrelevant or duplicate entries.
    * Standardizing text by converting everything to lowercase and removing unnecessary punctuation.
    * Ensuring a balanced class distribution between the two sentiment labels.
* **Training Process:**
We fine-tuned the distilbert-base-uncased model using the Hugging Face Trainer. The dataset was tokenized, and the model was trained for 3 epochs with a batch size of 16. The learning rate was set to 2e-5, and the weight decay was 0.01 to prevent overfitting.

The model shows good performance in distinguishing between positive and negative sentiment in movie reviews.

* **Application and Impact:**
This fine-tuned model could be used in various applications such as:

    * Automating sentiment analysis of movie reviews for entertainment platforms.
    * Analyzing customer feedback on products and services.
* **Potential Improvements:**

    * Data Augmentation: Increasing the dataset size would improve model generalization.
    * Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) could further enhance the model's performance.
